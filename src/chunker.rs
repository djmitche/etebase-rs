 * The rolling sum implementation is based on Rollsum from bup which is in turn based on rollsum from librsync:
 * https://github.com/bup/bup/blob/master/lib/bup/bupsplit.c
 * https://github.com/librsync/librsync/blob/master/src/rollsum.h
 *
 * We tried a few alternatives (see experiments/chunker/ for details) though this was by far the best one.
 *
 * The problem with using such a chunker is that it leaks information about the sizes of different chunks which
 * in turn leaks information about the original file (because the chunking is deterministic).
 * Therefore one needs to make sure to pad the chunks in a way that doesn't leak this information.
